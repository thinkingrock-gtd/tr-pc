        <h2>Projects Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            The following options can be set for projects.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <b>Automatically sequence actions.</b> Automatic sequencing is done at project level. 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If this option is not checked, no automatic sequencing is done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If this option is checked, all new projects will have automatic sequencing set to on. You can specify
                    the default settings: whether the sequencing should include actions within sub-projects
                    and whether scheduled and delegated actions should be included.<br>
                    These settings can be changed for any project in the projects screen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <b>Include Start date field.</b> If this option is checked the Start date field will be shown on action screens.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Include Due date field.</b> If this option is checked the Due date field will be shown on action screens. 
            </li>
            <li>

                </li>
            <li>
                <b>Initial action state field.</b> This option allows you to choose the initial action state (Inactive, Do ASAP, 
                Scheduled or Delegated) of new actions created using the projects tree. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Project reports page size.</b> This option allows you to choose the page size for the Print Outline and Print Detail
                reports which can be called from a project node in the projects tree. It is also used for the Action Print report
                which can be called from an action node in the projects tree.
