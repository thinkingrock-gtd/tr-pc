        <p>
            You can specify the output folder and the character encoding (e.g. UTF-8) of the exported file under 
            <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.extract/au/com/trgtd/tr/extract/docs/prefs-extract.html">Exports and Reports Preferences</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Parameters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Include Topic?: if checked, topics are included;</li>
            <li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>
            The file is saved in the folder specified within the user preferences (see Set-up).
            Current date and time are used to build the file name to make it unique. The output file is opened in the 
            text editor.
