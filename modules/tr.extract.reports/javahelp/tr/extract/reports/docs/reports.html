        <h2>Reports (Jasper)</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The reports can be divided into three types: action reports, project reports and item reports. 
            The action reports are for taking with you to do tasks and to review your short term work. 
            The project reports are for reviewing and planning your work.  Item reports show your someday/maybe
            list and your referenced information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reports are produced using JasperReports and can be saved in many 
            formats, including PDF. All reports use the DejaVu serif font. This font and its size 
            cannot be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most reports can be found under the Reports menu. In addition, the Project Outline, 
            Project Detail and Action Detail reports can be run from the popup menu (using the right mouse button 
            or control-key and mouse click) on any project or action in the project tree views.
        </p>
        <h3>Common parameters</h3>
        <p>

                are displayed on the report;</li>

                the action is displayed on the report in italic style;</li>

                is shown for single actions (between braces {}) or the project
                path is shown (between square brackets []) for actions part of a project;</li>
            <li><b>Include notes?</b>: if checked, the action notes are displayed on the

            <li><b>Actions: Do ASAP</b>: this report lists all Do ASAP actions grouped by context.
                Contexts are listed alphabetically and actions are
                ordered alphabetically within context. You can change the order within context to be by
                priority, energy or time. You can also select a specific context;</li>
            <li><b>Actions: Delegated</b>: this report lists all Delegated actions within a specified

            <li><b>Actions: Done</b>: this report lists all Done actions within a specified
                period. This report allows you to review whether due dates were met, which period was productive,
                in which area you are the most productive, performance of team members, etc.
                The actions are grouped into sections: Do ASAP (ordered by ascending Done date),
                Delegated (grouped by Delegate, ordered by ascending Done date), Inactive (ordered by

                for this report in the Reports menu so that you can design two pocketmod reports by selecting the
                pages and remembering the options;</li>
            <li><b>Single actions</b>: this report lists all the actions which are not part of a
                project. The Done State parameter allows you to select only current
                actions (To do), or done actions or all. You can also choose a specific topic or context.

            <li><b>Weekly Review</b>: this report lists the actions planned for today and this week.
                You can include overdue actions or not. The start parameter allows you to produce
                the report for today or tomorrow. If you select tomorrow, the report will list the
                actions planned for tomorrow under the Today section and the week starting the day
                after. The overdue actions are grouped into sections: Overdue Scheduled (ordered by ascending
                Scheduled date and time), Overdue Do ASAP (ordered by ascending Due date), Overdue Delegated
                (grouped by Delegate, ordered by ascending Follow-up date). In the Today section, the Scheduled
                actions for today are first listed in ascending order of time, then the Do ASAP actions due today
                grouped by context, then the Delegated actions to be followed up today group by delegate. In the This week
                section, all actions are listed together ordered by ascending date (and time for scheduled actions);

                can be set under the
