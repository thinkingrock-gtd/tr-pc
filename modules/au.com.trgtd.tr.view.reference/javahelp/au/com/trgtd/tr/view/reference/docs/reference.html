        <h2>Review Reference Items</h2> 
        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>
            This screen is where you review the references you have kept.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screen is divided horizontally into two parts. The top part contains the items as per your 
            selection (see filters). When an item is selected, the bottom part will display the details of the
            item.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Please note that all settings are kept when you exit the application, including the position of the 
            panels separation bars.
        <p>
        <h3>Columns</h3>
        <p>

            navigation bar on the right and check or unchecked the fields in the window accordingly.

            </li>
            <li>
                the column width.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>            
            The following filters are present: Created From, Created To, Topic selection and a Search facility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When there is more than one filter, data relevant for all filters is displayed (corresponding to logical 
            AND operation).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Search filter allows you to enter a text. Once you press the Enter key, all items which have the text 
            in their notes or description are listed.<br>
