        <h2>Archive</h2>
        <p>The archive process first saves a backup copy of your data file and
            then removes from the data file, all single actions and projects
            completed on or before a specified archive date. An archive file is
            created containing the archived single actions and projects.
        </p>
        The archive process is called from the File menu. &nbsp;You will need to enter:
        <ul>
            <li>the Archive Folder in which the archive file should be saved:
                we recommend you use a different folder to that of your data file;</li>
            <li>the Archive Date: the last archived date (if any) is
                displayed;</li>
            <li>check box Archive Done projects only: if checked, the whole top level project needs to
                have been completed by the archive date for actions to be archived. If unchecked, the 
                archiving is done on current projects or on projects completed after the archived date
                as long as the actions have been set to done before or on the archive date.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Press the Archive button to start the process. A message is displayed
            when the process has finished.
        </p>
        The following is a detailed description of the archiving process:
        <ol>
            <li>First a backup copy of the current data file is made, named
                {datafile-name}-{current-date}-{current-time}-backup.xml
                (e.g. thinking-rock-20070514-205057123.backup.xml)</li>
            <li>A second copy of the current data file is made, named:
                {datafile-name}-{archive-date}-{current-time}-archive.xml &nbsp;From this copy,
                the process removes:
                <ul>
                    <li>all single actions with no Done date or Done Date after
                        the Archived Date;</li>
                    <li>all unprocessed thoughts, Someday/Maybe Items and Reference
                        Items;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on done projects only: all top level Projects and
                        associated sub-projects and actions where the Project&#39;s with no Done Date
                        or Project&#39;s Completed Date after the Archived Date;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on all projects: all actions with no Done Date
                        or Done Date after the Archived Date. The project hierarchy is kept so
                        you might have a project appearing in both the current and archived data files;</li>
                    <li>all projects under the Future Tab;</li>
                    <li>all projects under the Templates Tab.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>From the current data file, the application removes:
                <ul>
                    <li>single actions with Done Date on or before the Archived Date;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on done projects only: all top Projects and associated
                        sub-projects and actions where the Project Completed Date is on or before
                        the Archive Date;</li>
                    <li>if archiving on all projects: all actions and sub-projects with Done Date or
                        Completed Date on or before the Archived Date.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <b>Notes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Projects and actions under the Future Projects and Template
                Projects Tab are never archived;</li>
            <li>Contexts, Topics and Criteria values are saved in the archived
                file;</li>
            <li>You can review archived data by opening the data file using
                ThinkingRock.</li>
