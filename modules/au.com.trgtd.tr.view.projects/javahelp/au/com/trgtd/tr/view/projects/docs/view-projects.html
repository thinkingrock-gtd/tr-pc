        <h3><a name="purp"/>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This screen is where you plan and review your projects. The screen is divided vertically
            into two parts. The left part is the project tree (explorer) and the right part displays
            the details of either a project/sub-project or an action depending on what is selected
            on the tree. When expanded the project tree shows sub-projects and actions under each
            project.
        </p>
        In the tree explorer, there are 4 tabs:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Projects: contains all your current projects;
            </li>

            <li>
                Single Actions: contains all your single actions, i.e. actions not part of a project;
            </li>                
            <li>
                Future: contains <b>projects</b> that got delayed, put on the side for a while or
                for which you decided to start the planning process in advance. It should not be 
                confused with Someday/Maybe Items which are just thoughts you might do one day. When the 
                project becomes current, you can cut and paste it to the Projects tab. You can 
                also use the Start date to get the project moved automatically to the Projects 
                tab (see below under Projects Operations, Edit);
            </li>
            <li>
                Templates: contains project structures you want to re-use like 'Start Marketing 
                Campaign for product X', 'Reply Offer To Tender Client Y', etc. To use a template
                for a new project, just copy and paste it into the Projects Tab and update 
                descriptions accordingly.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3><a name="nav"/>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            To navigate in the project tree, you can use the mouse or the up and down arrows keys. To
            navigate in the detail part, you can use the mouse or the Tab, Shift+Tab keys. To navigate between the 2
            parts, you can use the F5 key or the mouse.
        </p>
        <h3><a name="pt"/>Project Tree</h3>
        <b><i>Order</i></b><br><br>
        Initially the projects, sub-projects and actions are sorted in the order they were entered. You can change that order by:
        <ul>
            <li>
                selecting the projects, sub-projects or actions and move them up and down using the Move operation;
            </li>
            <li>
                using the drag and drop functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b><i>Drag and Drop functionality</i></b><br>
        <p>
            To move sub-projects and actions to a different project, you can drag and drop them using the mouse. You can also change a
            sub-project to be a stand alone project by dragging it under the All projects node. Similarly, you can drag a project under
            another project, changing it to a sub-project. If you drag a project or sub-project, all subtasks are moved too.
        </p>
        <b><i>Add Action and Add Project</i></b><br>
        <p>
            Add Action and Add Project operations work from anywhere in the 2 parts. The action or project will be added within the
            project the action or project previously selected is.
        </p>
        <p>
            An action created under an existing project will take the priority of that project.
            A sub-project created under an existing project will take the priority of that project.
        </p>
        <h3><a name="pop"/>Project Operations</h3>
        <p>
            To perform all operations except Add Action and Add Project, you need to select the project node and either use the right-click menu or the
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.model/tr/model/docs/shortcuts.html">Shortcut Key</a>

            assigned to the operation. You can also use the Add Action, Add Project or Show/Hide Done buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Except for Edit, Add action and Add project, all other operations can be performed to more than one project at the time. Just hold
            the Shift or Command key while selecting them.
        </p>
        <b><i>Edit</i></b><br>
        <p>
            Once you have selected a project, sub-project or action on the tree part, you can move to its description
            by using the Edit menu option or the Enter key. The cursor is then positioned at the end of the
            description.
        </p>
        The display of the following fields is configurable:
        <ul>

            <li>
                Project sequencing, Due Date and Start Date: see
                <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.prefs.projects/au/com/trgtd/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Priority, Time, Energy: see
                <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.view.criteria/au/com/trgtd/tr/view/criteria/docs/criteria.html">Criteria</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The following operations are possible:
        <ul>
            <li>
                modify its description;
            </li>
            <li>
                change its topic: when subtasks are created, the project topic is the default but can be overwritten;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its priority;
            </li>
            <li>
                plan the project/sub-project;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain Notes;
            </li>
            <li>
                set up the sequencing method (see
                <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.prefs.projects/au/com/trgtd/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>
                . Please note that when a sub-project is created, its default method for sequencing is the project&#39;s one;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain the Created Date if required. This needs to be enabled, see
                <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.prefs.projects/au/com/trgtd/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>;
            </li>
            <li>
                enter a Start date. For future project, when the Start date is reached or has passed (in case
                you don&#39;t run the application for a few days), the future project will be moved automatically
                to the Projects tab.
            </li>
            <li>
                enter a Due Date if appropriate;
            </li>
            <li>
                set it to done: a warning message is displayed if any subtask is not set to done. In this case, you can either cancel 
                (by selecting the No button) or continue (Yes button). If you continue the subtasks will be set to done automatically;
            </li>
            <li>
                reset it to not done. If you are resetting a sub-project within a done project, the project is
                automatically reset to not done.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <b><i>Expand All/Collapse All: tree expansion</i></b><br>
            The project/sub-project expands and the subtasks are listed under the project/sub-project. You can expand
            all projects by selecting the top node &quot;Projects&quot;. To perform the same operation, you can also
            click on the expansion symbol on the left of the project node.
        </p>
        <b><i>Show Done/Hide Done</i></b><br>
        When you perform the Show Done operation, done actions and done sub-projets for the selected node are shown as well
        as the undone ones. Perform Hide Done to only see the ones to be done.
        <p>
            <b><i>Add action</i></b><br>
            This operation adds an inactive action under the selected subtask. You can change the default
            status of that action under
            <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.prefs.projects/au/com/trgtd/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>.
            The whole action description is selected to allow you to type directly the action description.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Add project</i></b><br>
            This operation adds a sub-project under the selected subtask. The whole
            project description is selected to allow you to type directly the project description.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Copy, Cut and Paste functionality</i></b><br>
            You can copy, cut and paste projects (and their actions) to a different project. You can also change a
            sub-project to be a stand alone project by cutting and pasting it under the Projects node. Similarly,
            you can cut and paste a project under another project, changing it to a sub-project. If you copy/cut and
            paste a project or sub-project, all subtasks are copied/moved too. These operations can be done between
            Tabs too.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Move project</i></b><br>
            You can move a project or sub-project by selecting it and using this operation to move it up or down
            within the project it is in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Create Template</i></b><br>
            This function allows you to create a template from a project or sub-project. This is useful when you need to 
            repeat the project or do a similar project. The created template will appear in the Templates tab project tree.
            All dates in the created template are cleared except the Created Date, which is set to the current date.
            The Status of all Actions are set to Inactive. Notes are kept. 
        </p>
        <a name="export-template"/>
        <p>
            <b><i>Export Template</i></b><br>
            This function exports the selected project or sub-project into a separate file.
            You can then share this file with other TR users, within your team or with the
            TR community through the TR website. A file with the extension .trpt is created. This is
            the file the other users will need to import using the Import Project Template function.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Export Project</i></b><br>
            This function exports the selected project or sub-project into a separate file.
            You can then share this file with other TR users or within your team. A file with the extension .trp
            is created. This is the file the other users will need to import using the Import Project operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Import Project</i></b><br>
            This function lets you import a project created using the export project operation.
            You need to select a project file (.trp extension). The project will
            be added at the bottom of the selected project.<br>
            <br>
            If the contexts, topics and criteria values used in the project do not exist
            in your data file, the default values for these fields are used: &#39;None&#39; for topics
            and contexts, blank for criteria. So if you want to share projects within a team,
            make sure every user has the same set of values for these fields.
        <p>
            <b><i>Others</i></b><br>
            Change Topic: combo is displayed to select the new topic. <br>
            Delete: you can delete a project or sub-project. A confirmation is required.
        </p>
        <h3 id="plan"><a name="plan"/>Planning</h3>
        To plan the project/sub-project, there are five recommended steps:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Enter the purpose: this is the &quot;why&quot; you are doing this project/sub-project. By defining
                it, it will:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        create decision-making criteria;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        motivate;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        clarify your focus;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        expand options by getting you into creative thinking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to visualise the results: view the project/sub-project beyond the completion date (capture
                features, aspects, qualities you imagine in place);
            </li>
            <li>Brainstorming: just write all the ideas that come into your mind about this
                project/sub-project, you will analyse them and organise them later. In addition to
                capturing your original ideas, by brainstorming you will also have many new
                ideas. Don&#39;t ignore any idea, they might prove interesting or useful later
                on when you are developing your options. Also you will be more confident
                about your choices;
            </li>
            <li>
                Organising: a natural organisation will probably emerge during the
                brainstorming step. You need to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        identify the key steps;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sort them out by component, sequences and priorities;
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        detailed them to the right level.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Next actions: during this step, you will create the actions or sub-projects
                required for this project/sub-project. You can either just enter the next subtask to get the
                project/sub-project starting or continuing, or enter as many next subtasks you can think of at the moment about this
                project/sub-project and decide which ones are active (i.e. to be done currently).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Please note that there are no limits to sub-project nesting, i.e. a sub-project can include sub-projects,
            etc. but it is recommended not to use more than a few levels.
        </p>

        <a name="action-operations"/>
        <h3>Action Operations</h3>
        <p>
            To perform operations, you need to select the action node and either use the right-click menu or the
            <a href="nbdocs://tr.model/tr/model/docs/shortcuts.html">Shortcut Key</a>
            assigned to the operation. You can also use the Add Action, Add Project, Reprocess or Convert to Project buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Except for Edit, all other operations can be performed to more than one
            action at the time. Just hold the Shift or Command key while selecting them.
        </p>
        <b><i>Edit</i></b><br>
        <br>
        An action can be edited by selecting it from the project tree once the
        project/sub-project has been expanded. You can then:
        <ul>
            <li>
                maintain its description;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its topic, default to the project&#39;s topic;
            </li>
            <li>

                maintain its context;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its priority, time or energy;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain its status (which type of action is it: Do ASAP, Delegated, Scheduled, or Inactive);
            </li>
            <li>
                for scheduled actions only, you can enter
                <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.view.actns/au/com/trgtd/tr/view/actns/docs/recurrence.html">Recurrence</a> definition;
            </li>
            <li>
                add notes to it: this notes field is useful for storing an agenda (if action is Prepare Meeting), a list of
                questions (if action is Call Builder), for storing a list (if action is Get Christmas presents), etc;
            </li>
            <li>
                maintain the Created Date if required. This needs to be enabled, see
                <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.view.actn/au/com/trgtd/tr/view/actn/docs/actions-prefs.html">Actions Preferences</a>;
            </li>
            <li>
                set it to done: the done date is automatically set to today&#39;s date but can be modified;
            </li>
            <li>
                reset it to not done. If the action was within a done project/sub-project, the project/sub-project is automatically
                reset to not done;
            </li>

            <li>
                enter a start date if appropriate;
            </li>
            <li>
                enter a due date if appropriate.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b><i>Convert to project</i></b><br>
            Use this operation if you decide that this action should be decomposed into more than one action. A project (if single action) or
            a sub-project is then created automatically with the original action&#39;s description as the project/sub-project&#39;s description.
            The action&#39;s notes, topic, priority and due date are also copied to the project/sub-project. The original action is the first action of
            the project/sub-project.
        </p>
